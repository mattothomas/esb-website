Engineering Summer Bridge Program Website ðŸš€ðŸ”§

After going through the ESB program as a mentee last year, I saw how much it did for me. That's why I applied to become a mentor. Unfortunately, I wasn't accepted to be in the program, but I still wanted to help out and give back. That's why, despite no prior knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript, I spent nearly 200 hours of my spring break learning and creating the ESB website with my friend Daniel, with:
Responsive UI/UX Design ðŸ“±

Flexbox grid system with adaptive breakpoints for seamless mobile-to-desktop transitions
Interactive DOM Manipulation âš¡

Dynamic content rendering with vanilla JavaScript event listeners and lightbox galleries
Student Testimonials & Media Gallery ðŸ¤©

Real stories and epic moments captured in our CSS3 animated carousel
Backend API Integration ðŸ”„

Search functionality with JSON data structures and asynchronous fetch requests
And sooooo much more cool stuff! ðŸŽ‰

Check out our sick website at engineeringsummerbridge.edu and see what two sleep-deprived engineering students can build with nothing but energy drinks and determination! ðŸ’ª
